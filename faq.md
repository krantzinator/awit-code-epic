Code Epic/Quest FAQS

### Am I a good fit for the Code Epic?
Our Code Epics don’t require prior programming experience, but the program is challenging and requires basic computer skills in order to participate.

We also require weekly attendance at a mentor meeting (virtual or in-person), bi-weekly attendance at a sprint planning, monthly attendance at a retrospective, and daily participation in a Slack channel for the purposes of daily Stand-ups and being involved in your cohort’s learning journeys. If you cannot commit the time to these, you are not a good fit for our Epic and we encourage you to pursue learning through this curriculum on your own.

### What are the requirements?
Students will need access to a laptop to participate in the course.

Students are also required to complete a [prep work](/prep-work) course to be able to start the program once they are accepted.

### What is the structure of the Code Epic?
Code Epic has four main components:

- Pre-class coursework to prepare students for the beginning of class
- A core curriculum that supports students through the full Code Epic, and through each Code Quest
- Portfolio building projects to show prospective employers
- Job search mentorship and advice in the final Code Quest

### How much time will the class take?
Students should be prepared to commit at least 10 hours a week to the coursework and supplementary materials. Each Code Quest lasts 13 weeks, and the completion of four Code Quests give you completion of the full Code Epic.

### What if I am not accepted into the Code Quest?
You should still learn to code! We are limited on the number of people we can accept based on how many volunteer mentors we have, so don't take it personally!

Also, if someone who was accepted drops the Quest, we will contact people on the wait list to join in their place. If you keep up with the syllabus, you will be eligible for a spot on this wait list.

### What is the application process?
[Application Process](application-process.md).

Once we have filled a cohort, that cohort will be closed for the Code Epic and we will begin Quest 1.
