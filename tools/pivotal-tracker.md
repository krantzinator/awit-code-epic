Will go over this guide in the kickoff meeting for each cohort

Current
The current amount of work to be completed for that week

Backlog
Work that is coming up for the following week that has an estimated point value assigned

Icebox
Work on deck to move into the backlog once cards are fully completed with necessary information
These cards may, but do not always, have estimated point values assigned
Part of the typical work during a retrospective and sprint planning would be to assign points to cards. Given our usage of FCC’s hours estimation for our initial point value assignment, we will not spend time on this. However, we will use the time to break apart larger sections into smaller cards
i.e. Basic Front End Development Projects is estimated at 50 hours. That is too much for one card.
Since each project in the BFEDP is estimated roughly at ~25 hours each, they will need broken down further. A good place to start would be to make each User Story task within the project a separate card.

Epics
These are labels to allow project managers to track work done for each larger project. We have created an epic for each track in FCC’s map. For this first run of our Code Epic, all your cards will be assigned to the pic “front end development certification”

Pivotal Tracker will automatically move cards between the Icebox, Backlog, and Current based on our current Velocity. Velocity measures how many points of cards we complete each week. This is why it’s important to update the scores of cards once you completed it and know the accurate number of hours it took you to complete. This is also why you will need to create cards for side work that you do, if you complete the FCC work for the week early. This will allow us to track accurate time spent per week and improve current and future offerings of each Code Quest.

Cards
Cards following FCC’s curriculum will be created by the Project Manager
for the first month this will be the mentor; following weeks will rotate PM responsibilities throughout the cohort
Cards for alternate resources you choose to do will be created by you

Processes to iron out
Usage of tags
Do we want tags to indicate something requires ‘pair programming’?
What other tags?
Usage of Entry/exit tags or tasks in list?
