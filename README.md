# Prep work instructions

It is required that you complete the Required Reading section and the Additional Skills section. The other two sections -- Harvard CS50 and Viking Code School -- are optional. If you are a 100% beginner, I highly recommend picking at least one of those to complete. I am leaving it up to you to judge your own programming aptitude and decide how much prep work you would like to complete.
